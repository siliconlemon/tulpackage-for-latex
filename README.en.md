# tulpackage-for-latex

This LaTeX package is prepared for immediate use on the Overleaf platform. It includes styles and classes necessary for writing theses and other academic works in accordance with the guidelines of the Technical University of Liberec (TUL). This package represents a modified version of the original `tulthesis 2.1` package, with the aim of providing increased accessibility and ease of use, potentially at the cost of a larger number of imported packages and following structural changes in the repository.

**Important Note:** Although writing in English is possible with this package, all comments and documentation are currently provided only in Czech.

## ‚ú® Package Contents

The package provides all the necessary tools for creating documents that comply with the style of the Technical University of Liberec:

üìå **`tul.sty`:** This is the cornerstone of the entire package. It defines the main styles and formatting rules for all TUL documents.

üìÑ **`tulthesis`:** A specialized class intended for diploma theses and similar extensive works. It is based on `tul.sty` and features several enhancements for improved visual appearance.

üì∞ **`tularticle`:** A class designed for writing articles in the TUL style. Its use simplifies the preamble setup, allowing users to start writing directly without the need for complex configurations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Overleaf

For the utilization of this `tulpackage-for-latex` on the Overleaf platform, the following procedure is recommended:

1.  **Repository Download:** On the repository page on GitHub, it is necessary to click the "Code" button and subsequently select the "Download ZIP" option.
2.  **File Upload to Overleaf:** Within the user's project on Overleaf, it is necessary to click the "Add Files" button and then "Upload". Subsequently, the downloaded ZIP file is selected, which Overleaf will automatically unpack.

### üíª Local LaTeX Distribution (TeXworks, TeXstudio, etc.)

The package should also be usable on local devices (in TeXworks or TeXstudio) ‚Äì a check of the installation of all necessary LaTeX packages on which `tulpackage-for-latex` depends should suffice.

### üìù Getting Started

Several example documents illustrating the functionality of the package are included:

* `manual-tul.tex`: Shows how to use the basic `tul.sty` style with a standard document class.
* `manual-tulthesis.tex`: Provides an example of setting up the preamble and using the `tulthesis` class for diploma theses and similar works.
* `example-tularticle.tex`: This file demonstrates the use of the `tularticle` class for writing articles.

These files allow for examination of preamble setup and the structuring of LaTeX documents. Additionally, manuals in PDF format (`manual-tul.pdf`, `manual-tulthesis.pdf`, `example-tularticle.pdf`) are available, providing a more detailed explanation of all available functions and options. Their review is recommended.

## üé® Customization Options

The `tulpackage-for-latex` package offers several ways to customize the appearance of documents.

‚öôÔ∏è **Document Class Options:** As mentioned in the "Installation and Usage" section, both the `tulthesis` and `tularticle` classes have a number of options that can be set when declaring the document class in the LaTeX file. These options allow for:

* üé® Changing the document style according to the specific faculty (e.g., `FM`, `EF`, `FS`).
* ‚ö´ Enabling or disabling colored headings (`bwtitles`) or switching to a completely black and white mode (`bw`).
* <0xF0><0x9F><0x96><0x84> Setting which fonts will be used (`fonts`, `sfbody`, `sfheadings`).
* And much more. Exploration of all available options is recommended.

‚úçÔ∏è **Preamble Modifications:** If these options are insufficient, the document can be further customized by adding standard LaTeX commands and packages to the preamble of the `.tex` file. The example files (`manual-tul.tex`, `manual-tulthesis.tex`, `example-tularticle.tex`) illustrate how the preamble is set up. If commands are used/defined directly in the preambles, it signifies that their configuration is left to the user.

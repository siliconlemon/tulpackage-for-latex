# tulpackage-for-latex

An Overleaf-ready package designed to provide the necessary styles and classes for creating LaTeX papers that adhere to the style guide of the Technical University of Liberec (TUL). This package is an adjusted version of the original `tulthesis 2.1` package, aiming for improved accessibility and ease of use, though it might include some additional features.

**Important Note:** While the package supports writing papers in English, please be aware that all comments and current documentation within the package are written in Czech.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This package provides the essential building blocks for creating documents following the Technical University of Liberec style guide:

üìå **`tul.sty`:** The core of the package, defining the main styles and formatting rules for all TUL documents.

üìÑ **`tulthesis`:** A specialized document class for theses and similar report-based documents, built upon `tul.sty` with some aesthetic refinements.

üì∞ **`tularticle`:** An original document class designed to streamline the creation of article-style documents using the TUL style. It simplifies the preamble setup, making it easier to write articles without the usual extra configurations.

### üìù Basic Usage

This package includes several example documents that demonstrate how to use the different components. You can find these in the repository:

* `manual-tul.tex`: Illustrates the usage of the core `tul.sty` with a standard document class.
* `manual-tulthesis.tex`: Provides an example of how to set up the preamble and use the `tulthesis` document class for theses and similar reports.
* `example-tularticle.tex`: Shows an example of using the `tularticle` document class for article-style documents.

These example `.tex` files provide practical demonstrations of how to configure the preamble and structure your LaTeX documents. Additionally, the repository contains the compiled PDF manuals (`manual-tul.pdf`, `manual-tulthesis.pdf`, `example-tularticle.pdf`) which offer a more detailed explanation of the intended usage and available features. Be sure to check them out! üòâ

## üé® Customization

The `tulpackage-for-latex` offers several ways to tailor the appearance of your documents.

‚öôÔ∏è **Document Class Options:** As detailed in the "Installation and Usage" section, both the `tulthesis` and `tularticle` document classes provide a range of options that can be set when you declare the document class in your LaTeX file. These options allow you to:

* Change the document style to match your specific faculty (e.g., `FS`, `FT`, `FP`).
* Toggle monochrome headings (`bwtitles`) or switch to a completely monochrome mode (`bw`).
* Control font usage (`fonts`, `sfbody`, `sfheadings`).
* And much more! Be sure to explore the list of available options for each class.

‚úçÔ∏è **Preamble Adjustments:** For more fine-grained control, you can further customize your document by adding standard LaTeX commands and packages in the preamble of your `.tex` file. The provided example files (`manual-tul.tex`, `manual-tulthesis.tex`, `example-tularticle.tex`) demonstrate how you can set up the preamble. Any settings left in those examples are intended to be adjusted per document based on your specific requirements.
